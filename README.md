# RL Work w/ SAC & Gym-MuJoCo Environments

This notebook employs the Stable-Baselines implementation of SAC to train 4 Gym-MuJoCo environments.
I found that getting SAC to work was not all that difficult, but it can be a little daunting for
someone unfamiliar with the Stable-Baselines toolkit or the famous Levine et al. paper on SAC.
Code is a bit messy since it was written in ~2 weeks for a grad course and I was learning how to use
the OpenAI suite through this project.
